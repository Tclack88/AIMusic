The sheet music above represent was created by my AI trained on chopin etudes. It looks like music, but does it sound like real music? To find out, please visit my [blog post](https://tclack88.github.io/blog/code/2019/12/27/ai-music.html) on the subject

Apologies:

This repo is kind of blank. It's a bit of a mess and split with another [here](https://github.com/Tclack88/Machine-Learning-Projects/tree/master/GenerateMusic_NeuralNetwork_Incomplete). I intend to move some of that code over after I make improvements to the algorithm. A blog post on the failed first attempt can be found [here](https://tclack88.github.io/blog/code/personal/2019/08/15/music-generation-fail.html)
